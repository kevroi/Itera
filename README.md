# Mathematical-Modeling

This is a collection of python programs that model different mathematical phenomena. To quickly find the right file, just look up the file name below and put it in the repo's 'Go to file' button on top.

## Summation Formulae
These model summation formulae for constants and the first n natural numbers (along with their squares and cubes). The code can be found in `SumFormulae.py`

## Farey's Algorithm
Not the complete algorithm for generating Farey sequences, but it kind of works - there are some extra terms in the sequence it spits out. The code can be found in `Farey.py`

## Wave function of a particle in a bx with infinitely high walls
This soultion to the time independent Schr√∂dinger equation in 1 dimension is ploted out for the first 5 lowest possible energies in `InfiniteWall.py`

## Legendre Polynomials
The first 5 solutions to [Legendre's differential equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legendre_polynomials#Definition_via_differential_equation). The first plot renders the polynomial expansion of these solutions as a function of x, while the second plot renders them as functions of the trigonometric (sin(x), cos(x) & tan(x)) and hyperbolic (sinh(x), cosh(x) & tanh(x)) functions. The code is in `LegendrePoly.py`





## Dependencies
Requirements.txt will be uploaded soon.
