A folder dedicated to the study and implementation of $SO(3)$, the group of all rotations in 3D space. Coded in `C` as a bit of a challenge.

# Maths Refresher
Groups are collections of objects along with some kind of operator ( $+, -, \times, \div$ are examples of operators you learnt in school). They have to obey the axioms of a group:

* The operator can take in any two objects in the group and spit out a third object that is also in the group. [i.e. the group operation is closed]
* If we have a chain of operations, we can start an operator at any position and evaluate the final end result. [i.e. the group operation is associative]
* There exists an identiy element, that when operated with any other element returns the other element. [i.e an identity exists]
* All elements have an inverse, which when operated on with the element itself outputs the identity. [i.e. inverses exist]
